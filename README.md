# Problem Set 1
# Order of Codes, Results and Data
Software used: Python
To begin with, the codes are structured in a manner to make interpretation easier and to enhance reproducibility. The codes are structured as follows:

1. For agricultural production, profit and crop production is titled 'agric'
2. For consumption including livestock and others is titled 'csp'
3. For labor wages, business profit and transfers is titled 'labor'
4. For social demography / background/descriptive statistics of respondents is titled 'socdem'
5. For merging of the above 1 - 4 dataset is titled 'fullanalysis'
6. For the problem set 1 questions is titled 'PS1'
7. For the fulldata without the labor information is titled 'fulldata.csv'
8. The complete data with labor information such as hours per worker 'h' and ‘eh’ hours worked per adult in a household
Note: The only difference between fulldata.csv and labordata.csv is that labordata.csv contains 'h' and 'eh'. Yeah, i may be stupid at times as i should have merged the them together, but i couldn't solve for 'h' and 'eh' for a while and i left out questions regarding it until i got it right.
9. The results, output and intepretation of charts, tables and other comments of the problem set is titled 'BabaniyiOlaniyiFullUpdatedPS1'
10. Functions for trimming is titled "data_functions_albert". Many thanks to Albert Rodriguez


# Problem Set 2
Software used: Python
1. The solution is titled 'BabaniyiGnDPS2'
2. Python code is titled 'BabaniyiGnDPS2.py'

# Problem Set 3
Software used: Python and R
I used pythin for data imputation and cleansing, and R for iterating the regression and corresponding graphs.
1. The solution is titled 'PS3BabaniyiOlaniyi'
2. Python code is titled 'PS3.py'
3. R code is titled 'PS3.R'
4. Data used is titled 'dataUGA.dta'
